                <h2>Broom style Bonsai (Hokidachi)</h2>
                 <p>The broom style is suited for deciduous trees with extensive, fine branching. 
                The trunk is straight and upright and does not continue to the top of the tree; 
                it branches out in all directions at about 1/3 the height of the tree. 
                The branches and leaves form a ball-shaped crown which is also a stunning sight during winter months.</p>

            <h2>Literati Bonsai style (Bunjingi)</h2>
            <p>In nature this style of tree is found in areas densely populated by many other trees and 
                competition is so fierce that the tree can only survive by growing taller then all others around it. 
                The trunk grows crookedly upward and is completely without branching because the sun only hits the top of the tree. 
                To make sure that it looks even tougher, some branches are “Jinned” (without bark). 
                When the bark has been removed from one side of the trunk, the trunk is referred to as a “Shari”. 
                The idea is to demonstrate that the tree has to struggle to survive. 
                These trees are often placed in small, round pots.</p>

            <h2>Semi cascade Bonsai style (Han-kengai)</h2>
            <p>The semi-cascade style, just like the cascade style, is found in nature on cliffs and on the banks of rivers and lakes. 
                The trunk grows upright for a small distance and then bends downwards/sidewards. Unlike the cascade style, 
                the semi-cascade trunk will never grow below the bottom of the pot. 
                The crown is usually above the rim of the pot while subsequent branching occurs below the rim. </p>

            <h2>Informal upright Bonsai style (Moyogi)</h2>
            <p>The informal upright style is common in both nature and in the art of Bonsai. 
                The trunk grows upright roughly in the shape of a letter ‘S’ and at every turn branching occurs. 
                Tapering of the trunk must be clearly visible, with the base of the trunk thicker than the higher portion</p>

            <h2>Windswept Bonsai style (Fukinagashi)</h2>
            <p>The windswept style also is a good example of trees that must struggle to survive. 
                The branches as well as the trunk grow to one side as if the wind has been blowing the tree constantly in one direction. 
                The branches grow out on all sides of the trunk but will all eventually be bent to one side.</p>
